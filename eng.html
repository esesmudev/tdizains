    <blockquote>
      <p class="lead">Monday is the most difficult day of the week, as we have to get up early after the holidays</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On Monday there is only one lecture in the C part study course “Specialties in Latvian”. The aim is to improve the level of Latvian language skills, to speak and write fluently, observing the norms of Latvian literary language, to master the basic principles of choice of words and their forms. The aim of the course is to give an insight into the law of modern Latvian and the language of specialty. Although Latvian is my native language, the course gives me new knowledge in Latvian grammar. The lecture is only in the evening, so I go to work early in the morning. This semester lectures are held in different faculties and thus in different buildings. On Monday afternoon, I go to the Faculty of Humanities at 4a Visvalza Street. The faculty is located in a rather uncomfortable location where public transport to my area is not missed. There is a central station nearby, so on Mondays I go home by train by train.</p>
    <p>Monday can also create a positive wave of motivation and energy. If we feel positive about our lives and feel emotionally healthy, Monday can help us get started and spend the rest of the week in a positive mood. Monday brings good luck to the whole week. Everything you plan for a whole week on Monday is sure to work out. If you want to win the lottery, you choose the numbers on Monday. If you are planning an important event this week, you need to sit down on Monday and think about it calmly. Just under no circumstances do you start to realize something. If you make the wrong decision on this day, the whole week will fail.</p>

    <blockquote>
  	 <p class="lead">> By Tuesday morning, I was warming up for a working week. On this day there is a lecture in one of the most serious study courses “Mathematical Logic”</p>
    </blockquote>
  	<p>I go to work early in the morning. After two hours of work I go to university. On Tuesdays the lecture is in one study course - Mathematical Logic. The aim of the course is to develop the ability to write down their knowledge of formal languages, correct established logical reasoning errors, learn to recognize and construct their own strictly formal evidence, using only given axioms and no visual, intuitive, authoritative, etc. persuasion methods. The course should also teach the basics of expression logic and predicate logic. At the end of the course students should get an idea of the methods used in artificial intelligence systems, by which computers are able to draw their own conclusions and prove theorems: reduction of formulas in normal forms, scoreboard method, resolution method.</p>
  	<p>After the lecture I go to work again, and in the evening to Kipsala swimming pool swimming lessons, which help to relax after a long day, get new energy and take a back seat after work.</p>
  	<p>Unlike Monday, Tuesday counts as a favorable day in all respects. It is especially useful to go on a Tuesday, because any trip on this day will be favorable and successful. Any case launched on Tuesday is doomed to success. Tuesday is really able to help bring all the plans to life. You can expect anything - what was planned will succeed.</p>
  	<p>Tuesday - Not an easy day at all. But if you learn to behave properly, you can get a lot of good for yourself.</p>

  <div class="container description-container">
    <blockquote>
  	 <p class="lead">Wednesday is the day of the week when most university lectures are held. The day begins with the study course Mathematical Analysis II</p>
    </blockquote>
  	<p>In the first lecture of the course “Mathematical Analysis II” we start our head from the morning, work practically, solve tasks. In the second lecture we learn theory. "Mathematical Analysis II" is a direct continuation of the course "Mathematical Analysis I". In the course we continue to look at integral calculus, as well as get acquainted with the theory of queues and differential calculations of functions of several arguments (boundaries, continuity, differentiation, free and conditional extremes, multiple integrals), as well as their applications.</p>
  	<p>The next lecture is in the course "Database Practice" where we do MS SQL tasks using a computer using the MS SQL Server Management Studio tool. The aim of the course is to acquire practical skills of using SQL language. The course includes both theoretical and practical parts. Each theoretical topic is strengthened by appropriate practical work. Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Database Management System and Transact SQL Syntax are offered for example demonstration and problem solving.</p>
  	<p>Today's final lecture is at the Science House, Torņkalns, Jelgavas Street 3, in my chosen Part C course, Healthy Human Nutrition. When I arrive at the House of Science, I have some time to lecture, which I use usefully. I find a comfortable corner to study and work on. I believe that the Healthy Nutrition course is a successful choice because the nutritional knowledge I gained in my first lectures made me notice the shortcomings in my diet. The course dispels many myths, such as microwave cooked food is harmful to health. Not at all, by the way, cooked food in the microwave loses much less vitamins than, for example, frying in a pan. The course teaches you how to analyze food labels and analyze your menu.</p>
  	<p>In the evening of 15 minutes, I have to head back to Rainis Boulevard 19 for a special seminar "From Modern to Contemporary Art, from Design to Web Design", which introduces art and architecture from the mid-19th century to World War II.</p>
  	<p>Wednesday is the most optimal day to start solving your questions. Why is it? Even though the days are far behind, head clear, one can think rationally on both sides of the deal.</p>

  <div class="container description-container">
    <blockquote>
  	 <p class="lead">Thursday morning begins with a course called "Web Design Basics" where we learn the basic theoretical and practical skills in web visual design</p>
    </blockquote>
  	<p>During the semester, by implementing the tasks of image processing and writing, letter graphics, and web visual design, we reinforce the theoretical knowledge gained during the lectures. During the day the laboratory works for this course are also attended.</p>
  	<p>In the internet environment, appearance also matters. Just like in a business meeting, you create the impression of your company with a suit, manners and a well-groomed look, so the name and brand of the company on the World Wide Web is represented by none other than your company website.</p>
  	<p>A website is like a business card for anyone to read when searching for services or products related to your industry. However, how do you understand what kind of global web business card design to choose for your company? How to make a mistake and understand what a company look like on the Internet will give the brightest, best and most professional impression?</p>
  	<p>The next lecture is in the course “Formal Grammar”, which introduces the mathematical models used to study the basic capabilities of computers and programs, as well as syntax descriptions and algorithms for syntactic analysis of programming languages. Contextual grammar and magazine (stack) machines, their interrelation are considered. The above concepts are illustrated by many examples. Special attention is paid to developing the skills of analyzing and synthesizing non-context grammar and magazine machines.</p>
  	<p>Day at University continues with a lecture course on Database II where we deepen our understanding of how relational databases work. During the course we learn the data structures and algorithms that are used in relational database implementations.</p>
  	<p>After university I go to work. Later in the evening I go to the swimming pool in Kipsala swimming pool, which helps to relax after a long day, gain new energy and take care of our back after sitting.</p>
  	<p>Thursday is a light day that promises good luck at every start. It is an amazing day full of wisdom and intelligence.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="lead">Friday I spend all day at work. This is the only weekday on which the university has no lectures</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>On Friday, the whole day is devoted to mobile app development. I'm developing apps for iOS for iPhone smartphones. They are written in the Swift programming language and developed in the Xcode integrated development environment. Swift is an object-oriented programming language. In 2014, Apple introduced it specifically for iOS software development. It was created to improve alternative Objective-C programming on Apple devices. The Swift programming language is one of the most rapidly developed programming languages ​​by popularity and is designed for MacOS and iOS operating system software development. Swift makes the code easier to read and write, while giving the developer the control he needs in the true system programming language. Swift supports the inferred ways to make the code cleaner and less prone to error. Memory is managed automatically and you don't even need to enter semicolons. Swift is gaining popularity with iOS developers every day. This can be explained by the fact that the language is very easy for beginners and advanced programmers to understand. I'm currently involved in a public chat.</p>
    <p>To make effective use of Friday's energy, plan the time you spend with your loved ones and work on creative projects that may be still in development. Try not to plan too tight on this day as Friday is for relaxation and entertainment.</p>

    <blockquote>
  	 <p class="lead">Saturday's first part of the day is devoted to relaxation, followed by university homework</p>
  	</blockquote>
    <p>Saturday morning with family and friends we go to Jurmala for a walk, breathe fresh air and get new energy. Our goal is to walk at least 10,000 steps, which is the norm for the day. We walk along the seaside, along the landscaped forest park, Jomas Street. Sometimes I go out for a walk in the local forest in my area.</p>
  	<p>Weekly homework on "Mathematical Logic", "Mathematical Analysis II" and "Formal Grammar" must be solved every weekend, which greatly helps to strengthen the subject matter of the lectures.</p>
  	<p>If you are thinking of something important, it is best to start it on Saturday. It is good to start important negotiations this day as any contract will be profitable. If you start any kind of needlework on a Saturday, you will only do it on Saturdays, and you will not be able to get hold of it during the week. If you travel on a Saturday, it will be planned and set. Nothing on the way will break, robbers will not attack, and predators will also be on the sidelines. The purpose of the trip will also be fully realized.</p>
  	<p>Who moves to a new place on Saturday to live long and happy there. Those who change their bed linen on Saturday will never get insomnia.</p>

    </blockquote>
  	<p>On Sunday all outstanding work is done, both at university and at work. Also on Sunday I go out for a walk around the area and the nearby park. Since I do not like to sit at home all day, no day of the week is unthinkable without leaving home.</p>
  	<p>There is no brighter and brighter day than Sunday. It is a day of joy, happiness, to enjoy life, for the sun is the guardian. It gives life to everything on the planet, warms and nourishes all living on earth. Sunday is good for self-discovery, development, exploration of nature and the surrounding area. On this day, you need to think about the meaning of life to understand how to live what you need to achieve in your life.</p>
  	<p>On Sunday, creative people are born to serve beauty and the arts. They are very talented. As you can see, Sunday is a very good day in all respects - you can devote enough time to yourself, your children, your family. It is best to spend the day outdoors. Thanks to this relaxation, you can accumulate health and get closer to your loved ones.</p>
